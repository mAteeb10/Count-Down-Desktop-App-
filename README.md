Progress Bar Simulation using Threads and GUI
Introduction:
The "Progress Bar Simulation" project aims to demonstrate the use of threads and graphical user interface (GUI) in Java. The project involves creating a simple GUI window with a progress bar that simulates the progress of a task. The progress bar updates continuously until it reaches 100%, and the user can start or stop the progress using a button.
Objectives:
•	Utilize Java's threading capabilities to run a task in the background while updating the GUI.
•	Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing components to display a progress bar.
•	Allow the user to start and stop the progress using a button.
Project Components
1. ProgressBarGUI Class:
The ProgressBarGUI class is the main class of the project. It extends JFrame to create a GUI window with the following components:
•	JProgressBar: A progress bar that visually represents the progress of the task.
•	JButton: A button to start and stop the progress.
The ProgressBarGUI class also includes an inner class called WorkerThread, which extends Thread. This inner class represents the background task that runs in a separate thread to simulate the progress.
2. WorkerThread Class:
The WorkerThread class is an inner class of ProgressBarGUI, responsible for simulating the progress. Inside the run method, it updates the progress bar value using SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to ensure the update occurs on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). The thread checks for interruptions using Thread.currentThread(). isInterrupted(), allowing the user to stop the progress by clicking the button.
3. Main Method:
The main method is used to initialize the ProgressBarGUI object and start the GUI. It uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to invoke the GUI creation on the EDT.


Implementation Steps:
Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE.
Implement the ProgressBarGUI class with the necessary components, event listeners, and the WorkerThread inner class.
Test the application to ensure that the progress bar starts and stops as expected.
Conclusion:
The "Progress Bar Simulation" project successfully demonstrates the use of threads and GUI in Java to create a graphical application with a progress bar. The project achieves the objectives by running a background task in a separate thread while updating the progress bar on the GUI. The user can start and stop the progress using a button, providing a basic interactive experience.
Future Enhancements:
The project can be further improved by adding the following features:
1.	Implementing a more complex task that takes longer to complete, allowing for a more realistic simulation.
2.	Adding a text label to display the percentage of progress.
3.	Including multiple progress bars for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
4.	Implementing error handling and graceful termination when the application is closed.
